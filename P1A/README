lab1a.c
	As a reference for the combined utilization of the fork(2), exec(3), and
	wait(2), I used Figure 5.4 in Arpaci textbook. More specifically, it is
	located on page 8 of Chapter 5. As a reference for pipe(2), I used the
	example included within the manpage. For all other syscalls, I used the
	examples and information included within the manpages on lnxsrv09. As a
	reference for finding out exactly how the exit signal and status are
	recovered, and the appropriate macro to use, I look at the website:
	https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nico/archive/+/v0.01/include/sys/wait.h

Makefile
	The makefile correctly determines if the lab1a executable needs to be
	re-generateg, via the lemtion of lab1a.c in the dependencies for the
	lab1a target. The 'clean' target will return the directory to an
	un-tared state, and the 'dist' target will create a tar.gz file with the
	appropriate student ID, containing all files necessary to re-create the
	program. I used the lab 0 Makefile as a reference.

README
	The README file contains explanations of all the files that will be
	included within the distribution file.
