Makefile
	This Makefile contains targets to build the program, execute automated
	smoke tests, remove all generated files, and create the distribution
	tarball.

README
	This file contains explanations of all the other files in the
	distribution tarball, as well as the sources used to create said files.

lab4c_tcp.c
	This source file contains the target executable that will be generated
	by the Makefile. As a reference, I used the source code for lab4b.c.

lab4c_tls.c
	This source file contains the target executable that will be generated
	by the Makefile. As a reference, I used the source for lab4b.c,
	lab4c_tls.c, and the OpenSSL example at
	https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Simple_TLS_Server.
