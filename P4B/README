Makefile
	This Makefile contains targets to build the program, execute automated
	smoke tests, remove all generated files, and create the distribution
	tarball.

README
	This file contains explanations of all the other files in the
	distribution tarball, as well as the sources used to create said files.

lab4b.c
	This source file contains the target executable that will be geanerated
	by the Makefile. I used the article titled "Beaglebone Tutorial: GPIO,
	Interrupt, Analog, and PWM" which was linked to in the Project 4A
	specification as a reference as to how to access the peripherals. I also
	used the official MRAA documentation as well as the official Grove
	temperature sensor documentation, both of which are linked in the
	spec. I also used the manpages for localtime(3) and time(3).
