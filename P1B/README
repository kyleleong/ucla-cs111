lab1b-client.c
	This is the client. As a reference for the syntax and error checking
	conditions of the strtol function, I used the site:
	http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strtol.3.html. I also used the TA
	Rishab's GitHub for instructions regarding how to use poll and zlib
	which is at the URL:
	https://github.com/rishabkdoshi/CS111/blob/master/week3/examples/. For
	instructions on how to detect if a socket is closed, I used the example
	here: http://stefan.buettcher.org/cs/conn_closed.html. For the
	implementation of zlib compression, I used the file at
	http://zlib.net/zpipe.c as a reference. I credit
	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1632201/error-deflate-and-inflate-with-zlib
	with helping me figure out how to link against the zlib library.

lab1b-server.c
	This is the server. Many of the resources that I used for the
	lab1bclient.c source file were also used for this program.

Makefile
	As a reference for the special variables in a Makefile, I used
	https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Automatic-Variables.html.
	The Makefile supports building the client and server in the same target
	(the default one), and it also supports building the client and server
	separately. The client and server are compiled with the flags required
	in the spec. The Makefile also supports the dist and clean targets which
	generate the submission tarball and clean files generated by the
	compiler.

README
	This README contains information about all the other files that are
	included in the distribution tarball. It also contains information
	regarding works cited, and any other "gotchas" that may be present in
	the code.
